# With Constraints

## SUBJECT
- `SUBJECT_ELECTIVE IN ('P','W','Z')`
- `SUBJECT_CURRICULUM >= 0 AND SUBJECT_SCHEDULE >= 0`

## ACADEMIC_STAFF_WORKLOAD

## Notes about IDs / Keys (SCHEMA_MAIN)
Not every entity has a single surrogate `ID`. The schema uses a mix of:
- **Single-column primary keys**
  - `FACULTY(FACULTY_SHORT_NAME)`
  - `SUBJECT(SUBJECT_NR)`
  - `ACADEMIC_STAFF(ACADEMIC_STAFF_ID)`
  - `DEGREE_PROGRAM(DEGREE_SHORT_NAME)`
  - `LECTURER(ACADEMIC_STAFF_ID)`
- **Composite primary keys**
  - `ACADEMIC_STAFF_WORKLOAD(SEMESTER_NR, ACADEMIC_STAFF_ID)`
  - `COURSE(SUBJECT_NR, DEGREE_SHORT_NAME)`
  - `COURSE_ASSIGNMENT(SUBJECT_NR, COURSE_ASSIGNMENT_TERM, ACADEMIC_STAFF_ID)`
